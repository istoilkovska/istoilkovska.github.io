I hold a PhD in Computer Science, specializing in formal verification of distributed algorithms. My experience spans academic research and industry applications of formal methods and automated reasoning techniques.

In industry, I worked as an applied scientist at Prime Video from September 2021 until December 2024, developing static code analysis tools for TypeScript programs, and more recently, exploring applications of LLMs. 
From January 2020 to April 2021, I was a research engineer at [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems/), working on formally specifying and verifying blockchain protocols using TLA+. 
In academia, while pursuing my PhD degree, I worked as a research assistant at [TU Wien](https://forsyte.at/), where I developed automated tools for ensuring that synchronous fault-tolerant distributed algorithms behave according to their specifications.
